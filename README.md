# ðŸš€ Microsoft Fabric Sales Data Analytics Project

An **end-to-end analytics pipeline** built with **Microsoft Fabric** to demonstrate how raw sales data can be transformed into meaningful insights.  
This project covers everything from **data ingestion** to **reporting** in Power BI.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **real-world analytics flow** for Sales data using Microsoft Fabric:

1. **Ingestion**
   - Sales data (CSV via API) is ingested into a **Lakehouse**.
   - Orchestrated using a **Pipeline** with activities: Delete â†’ Copy â†’ Notebook â†’ Dataflow.

2. **Transformation**
   - **PySpark Notebook**: Enriches data with `Year` and `Month` columns.
   - **Dataflow Gen2**: Splits `CustomerName` into `FirstName` and `LastName` â†’ saved into `newsales` table.

3. **Warehouse**
   - Data is loaded into **LT_Reporting_DWH** containing:
     - **Fact_Sales**
     - **Dim_Customer**
     - **Dim_Item**
   - A stored procedure (`Sales.LoadDataFromStagingLakehouse`) manages loading from staging into fact/dim tables.

4. **Semantic Model**
   - One-to-Many relationships defined:
     - `Fact_Sales.CustomerID` â†’ `Dim_Customer.CustomerID`
     - `Fact_Sales.ItemID` â†’ `Dim_Item.ItemID`

5. **Reporting**
   - Power BI connected to the semantic model.
   - Visualizations include:
     - Monthly sales trends ðŸ“Š
     - Total items sold ðŸ›’
     - Line chart: Quantity vs OrderDate ðŸ“ˆ
